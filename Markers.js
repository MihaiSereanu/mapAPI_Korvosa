In some cases, a ritual is performed at the discretion of High Priestess Keppira D'bar to deem if one's soul is worthy of an extended lease on life. Pharasma speaks through her and judges the soul - but even if successful however, this gift is temporary - and only lasts until the soul has fulfilled its purpose in the Material Plane.");
